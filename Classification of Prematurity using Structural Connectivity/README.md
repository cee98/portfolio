# Classification of Prematurity using Structural Connectivity

## Problem description:
To predict whether the baby is born preterm from the structural connectivity matrices, which are a measure of connectivity between pairs of brain regions. 

## Feature variables:
There is 90 regions and matrices have 90x90 values. They are symmetric and have zeros on the diagonal (the connectivity of a region with itself is not meaningful).

## Target variables:
1 - premature <br>
0 - term-born

## Programming language:
Python 

## Libraries:
Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikitplot

## Algorithms:
.....

## Models built:
Logistic Regression, Random Forest

## Methods of model evaluation
Accuracy, Sensitivity, Specificity, Recall

## Summary of Results:
.....

## Limitations:
