## Clasification of Prematurity Using Structural Connectivity [click here](https://github.com/cee98/portfolio/tree/main/Classification%20of%20Prematurity%20using%20Structural%20Connectivity)
- Objective is to predict whether a baby is born preterm or not using structural connectivity matrices. 
- Matrices encapsulate the connectivity between pairs of brain regions, aiding in understanding neural networks.
- The primary goal is to develop an accurate classifier to predict prematurity while identifying the connections most predictive of this condition.

## Deep Learning for Segmentation of the Fetal Face From 3D T2W Fetal MRI [click here](https://github.com/cee98/portfolio/tree/main/Deep%20Learning%20for%20Segmentation%20of%20the%20Fetal%20Face%20From%203D%20T2W%20Fetal%20MRI)
- This study aims to implement and evaluate DL pipelines for the segmentation of the fetal face from 3D T2-weighted fetal MRI.
- Segmentation of Ground Truth Labels: Manual segmentations were performed by a single operator using ITK snap (version 2.2.0) by implementing a semi-automated method based on image thresholding and manual editing.
