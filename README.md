## Clasification of Prematurity Using Structural Connectivity [click here](https://github.com/cee98/portfolio/tree/main/Classification%20of%20Prematurity%20using%20Structural%20Connectivity)
- Objective is to predict whether a baby is born preterm or not using structural connectivity matrices. 
- Matrices encapsulate the connectivity between pairs of brain regions, aiding in understanding neural networks.
- The primary goal is to develop an accurate classifier to predict prematurity while identifying the connections most predictive of this condition.
