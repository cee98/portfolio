## Python

### 1. Clasification of Prematurity Using Structural Connectivity [click here](https://github.com/cee98/portfolio/tree/main/Classification%20of%20Prematurity%20using%20Structural%20Connectivity)
- The objective is to predict whether a baby is born preterm or not using structural connectivity matrices. 
- Matrices encapsulate the connectivity between pairs of brain regions, aiding in understanding neural networks.
- The primary goal is to develop an accurate classifier to predict prematurity while identifying the connections most predictive of this condition.

### 2. Deep Learning for Segmentation of the Fetal Face From 3D T2W Fetal MRI [click here](https://github.com/cee98/portfolio/tree/main/Deep%20Learning%20for%20Segmentation%20of%20the%20Fetal%20Face%20From%203D%20T2W%20Fetal%20MRI)
- This study aims to implement and evaluate DL pipelines for the segmentation of the fetal face from 3D T2-weighted fetal MRI.
- Segmentation of Ground Truth Labels: Manual segmentations were performed by a single operator using ITK snap (version 2.2.0) by implementing a semi-automated method based on image thresholding and manual editing.
  - 1 - face segmentation pixel
  - 0 - background pixel

### 5. Evaluating Imaging and genetic markers of Alzheimer disease [click here](https://github.com/cee98/portfolio/tree/main/Evaluating%20Imaging%20and%20genetic%20markers%20of%20Alzheimer%20disease)
-The aim of this project is to perform an analysis to decide which of the polymorphisms ApoE2, ApoE3, and ApoE4 are increasing the risk, decreasing the risk or have no effect on development of Alzheimer disease in an individual. 
Volumetric information from 1513 subjects in a tabular form, as well as some clinical assessment scores, demographic information and genetic markers. Patients are either cognitively normal (1), suffer from mild cognitive impairment (2) or have been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease (3). This information is encoded as "Diagnosis". ApoE copy 1 and ApoE copy 2 denote the version of the two alleles of the gene ApoE that are expressed by the subjects. MMSE denotes the score obtained by the subjects when doing the Mini-Mental State Exam, that consists in a set of questions to assess cognition and function. CDR (Clinical Dementia Rating) is a global rating used to quantify the severity of the dementia symptoms.
