### Projects
Clasification of Prematurity Using Structural Connectivity
- Objective is to predict whether a baby is born preterm or not using structural connectivity matrices. 
- Matrices encapsulate the connectivity between pairs of brain regions, aiding in understanding neural networks.
- The primary goal is to develop an accurate classifier to predict prematurity while identifying the connections most predictive of this condition.
